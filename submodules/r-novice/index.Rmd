Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested
in working with ecology data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons will be taught over three days. They start with
some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through
how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors,
how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a
data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.

## Days

1. [Day1](_episodes_rmd/00-day-1.Rmd)
2. [Day2](_episodes_rmd/01-day-2.Rmd)
3. [Day3](_episodes_rmd/02-day-3.Rmd)

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below.  To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything *before* working through this lesson.

### Data

Data files for the lesson are available and can be downloaded manually here: <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459>

However, we will download them directly from R during the lessons when we need
them.
